# MapRecovery

MapRecovery will be a web app that allows users to report various types of damage—such as electrical issues, cracks, and flooding—directly on an interactive city map. Users will be able to select a damage type, enter location details, and submit a report. The map will then highlight areas with frequent reports, helping local governments and contractors monitor and respond to infrastructure issues effectively. This prototype will use a mapping API and a database to visualize and store reports, providing insights into damage patterns across the city.
